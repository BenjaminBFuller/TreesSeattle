# Trees of Significance in Seattle
In Seattle, there are over 170,000 trees formally marked in the public right of way. Trees in the Seattle trees public data set contain [attributes] as metadata, providing descriptors and pertinent information to the public, such as location, age, and species. As of January 2023, 3,129 of the marked trees in Seattle are categorized as 1 of the 4 attributes:
- Heritage
- Exceptional
- GSI
- Green Factor

Trees are very important to our ecosystem, capturing and filtering stormwater runoff, reducing harmful pollutants, providing shade and mitigating summer air temperatures, and improving physical and mental health benifits, just to name a few things. For the sake of this project, a tree in the public right of way that is marked as one or more of these categories is classified as "Significant". To all the other hundreds of thousands of trees: you are special in your own way.

## Heritage
A tree part of the [Heritage Tree Program](https://www.seattle.gov/transportation/projects-and-programs/programs/trees-and-landscaping-program/heritage-tree-program).

## Exceptional
An [exceptional](https://www.seattle.gov/Documents/Departments/UrbanForestryCommission/Resources/DR2008-16xExceptionalTrees.pdf) tree is a tree that:
- 1. Is designated as a heritage tree by the City of Seattle; or
- 2. Is rare or exceptional by virtue of its size, species, condition, cultural/historic importance, age, and/or contribution as part of grove of trees as determined by the method discussed below.

## GSI
The (Green Street Initiative (GSI))[https://streetsillustrated.seattle.gov/urban-design/green-streets/] creates Green Streets, a land use code designation, which are "designed to give priority to pedestrian circulation and open space over other transportation uses."

## Green Factor
Trees with this attribute are part of the (Seattle Green Factor)[https://www.seattle.gov/sdci/codes/codes-we-enforce-(a-z)/seattle-green-factor], "a score-based code requirement that increases the amount of and improves the quality of landscaping in new development. Landscaping plays an important role in how new development looks and functions. Well-designed landscaping:

- Improves the look and feel of a neighborhood
- Reduces stormwater runoff
- Cools cities during heat waves
- Provides habitat for birds and beneficial insects
- Supports adjacent businesses
- Decreases crime"
